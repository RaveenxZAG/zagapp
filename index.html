    <h1>Hello, Im Building a Continuous Delivery Pipeline for Cloud-Native Apps on GCP</h1>
    <p>This project involves building a continuous delivery pipeline for a cloud-native web 
        application using Node.js on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). It includes tasks such as 
        building the application, containerizing it with Docker, setting up GCP, configuring 
        CI/CD pipelines, and implementing monitoring and logging. The goal is to automate the 
        process of building, testing, and deploying the application in a reliable and secure manner.</p>
